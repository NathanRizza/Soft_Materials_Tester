//Rules:
/*
1. Check if connection with Arduino is made
2. If Arduino is connected then take input from user in a String
3. Make a char array of the size of string + 1
4. Copy the whole string into the char array
5. Add escape sequence \n because this represents the end of a line in Serial Comm port
6. Write the whole char array into the buffer (a buffer takes the info forward to the Serial Comm Port)
7. Read from the Arduino if data is received successfully or if the action is taken as per needed
